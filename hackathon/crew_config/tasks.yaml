parse_text_task:
  description: >
    Parse the provided natural language {filter_text} to generate a filter formula for contracts.
  expected_output: >
    A filter formula based on the input text for contracts. The return format should be exactly as shown. Nothing less and nothing more. 
    The output should be a single string containing the filter formula without any additional text or formatting.
    Ensure to capture all the mentioned criteria in the input and construct the filter formula accordingly.
    Example format:
      Date-related examples:
        - Input: "Show me contracts created in last 7 days"
          Output: "And(And(GreaterThanOrEqual([workflowCreatedDate], RelativeDate(Today(), -7, \"days\")), LessThanOrEqual([workflowCreatedDate], Today())))"
        - Input: "Show me contracts created in the last month"
          Output: "And(And(GreaterThanOrEqual([workflowCreatedDate], RelativeDate(Today(), -30, \"days\")), LessThanOrEqual([workflowCreatedDate], Today())))"
        - Input: "Show me contracts that will expire in the next 7 days"
          Output: "And(And(LessThanOrEqual([expirationDate], RelativeDate(Today(), 7, \"days\")), GreaterThanOrEqual([expirationDate], Today())))"
        - Input: "Show me contracts that will expire today"
          Output: "And(Equals([expirationDate], Date(2024, 6, 13)))"  
      


      Type-related examples:
        - Input: "Show me contracts of record type NDA and Imported"
          Output: "And(In([recordTypeId], \"nda\", \"imported\"))"
        - Input: "Show me contracts of record type NDA"
          Output: "And(Equals([recordTypeId], \"nda\"))"
        - Input: "Show me all the records with record type as nda and esa and imported"
          Output: "And(In([recordTypeId], \"nda\", \"esa\", \"imported\"))"


      Counterparty-related examples:
        - Input: "Show me contracts with Pepsi"
          Output: "And(Equals([counterpartyName], \"Pepsi\"))"
        - Input: "Show me all contracts that are not with Pepsi "
          Output: "And(NotEqual([counterpartyName], \"Pepsi\"))"
           

      Stage-related examples:
        - Input: "Show me contracts which are at the stage review"
          Output: "And(Equals([workflowDetailsCombinedStage], \"review\"))"
        - Input: "Show me contracts which are at the stage approval"
          Output: "And(Equals([workflowDetailsCombinedStage], \"approval\"))"
    
      AND operator examples:
        - Input: "Show me contracts created in last 7 days and record type NDA"
          Output: "And(And(GreaterThanOrEqual([workflowCreatedDate], RelativeDate(Today(), -7, "days")), LessThanOrEqual([workflowCreatedDate], Today())), Equals([recordTypeId], "nda"))"
        - Input: "Show me contracts created in last 7 days and record type NDA and stage review"
          Output: "And(And(GreaterThanOrEqual([workflowCreatedDate], RelativeDate(Today(), -7, "days")), LessThanOrEqual([workflowCreatedDate], Today())), Equals([recordTypeId], "nda"), Equals([workflowDetailsCombinedStage], "review"))"
        - Input: "Show completed NDA's in last 7 days"
        - Output: "And(Equals([workflowDetailsCombinedStage], "completed"), Equals([recordTypeId], "nda"), And(GreaterThanOrEqual([workflowCreatedDate], RelativeDate(Today(), -14, "days")), LessThanOrEqual([workflowCreatedDate], Today())))"
