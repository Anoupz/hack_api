  sample_formats:
    - Input: "Show me contracts created in last 7 days"
      Output: "And(And(GreaterThanOrEqual([workflowCreatedDate], RelativeDate(Today(), -7, \"days\")), LessThanOrEqual([workflowCreatedDate], Today())))"
    - Input: "Show me contracts of record type NDA and at the stage review"
      Output: "And(Equals([recordTypeId], \"nda\"), Equals([workflowDetailsCombinedStage], \"review\"))"
    - Input: "Show me all the records with record type as nda, esa, and imported"
      Output: "And(In([recordTypeId], \"nda\", \"esa\", \"imported\"))"
    - Input: "Show me contracts created in last 7 days and signed by John Doe"
